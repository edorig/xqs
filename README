# README for xqs
#

Version: 1.0

Requirements:
------------
X11R5(4?)
Motif 1.2


To compile xqs:
------------
  1.  ./configure  (must supply base location of motif libs and headers 
	if diff't from the X distribution, see command line option below )

  2.  make

  3.  If problems compiling do a "./configure --help" or edit the Makefile 
      to suit your system


Command line options for Configure
-------------
  --with-motif-dir=DIR		: Motif includes and libraries are in 
				  DIR/include and DIR/lib respectively(only 
				  needed if diff't from standard X libs
  --with-motif-includes=DIR	: location of the Motif header files, overrides
				  --with-motif-dir=DIR
  --with-motif-libraries=DIR	: location of the Motif libraryfiles, overrides
				  --with-motif-dir=DIR 
  --x-includes=DIR		: X include files are in DIR
  --x-libraries=DIR		: X libraries are in DIR
  --help 			: displays all the command line option for
				  configure 

NOTE:  ./configure --help,  for a complete listing of command line options


Tab Descriptions:
------------
Display: uses code from xdyinfo to print information associated with a display
	connection
Clients: uses code from xlsclients to print a list of the X clients running
	on a display server
Windows: uses code from xwininfo to print information associated with a 
	window on a display, windows are selected in the WinTree list
Properties: uses code from xprop to print the properties associated registered
	with a display server
Resources: prints the resources associated with a display, uses the 
	RESOURCE_MANAGER property
Access:	prints a hosts connection access status, i.e who can and cannot connect
	to a display server


Usage:
-------
- Button 3 pops up the preferences selection box for the currently active tab 
as well as in the WinTree
- Re-click the active folder's tab to update the folder with the most 
current information

Also incorporated and adapted code from several of the standard X clients
including xdyinfo, xlsclients, xwininfo and xprop

Note:
==== 

Added 12/19/2015: 
The Makefile.in files are defective, so the ./configure script 
generates bad Makefiles. 

I have tried to correct the Makefile.in files, by removing incorrect
options, placing libraries in the logical order, fixing some syntax
errors but I cannot ensure that the generated Makefiles will work
correctly. In case compilation fails, it is easier anyway to correct 
directly the generated Makefiles than to edit the Makefile.in files. 

The only bug, once the program is compiled, is that clicking on
"Properties" tab results in a Segmentation fault when the window manager 
is CDE's dtwm but not with mwm. GDB is not very
useful to locate the origin of the bug, it looks like a series of 195
function calls: 
[...]
#188 0x616d656e in ?? ()
#189 0x662e7363 in ?? ()
#190 0x6765726f in ?? ()
#191 0x6e756f72 in ?? ()
#192 0x745c3a64 in ?? ()
#193 0x63616c62 in ?? ()
#194 0x226e5c6b in ?? ()
#195 0x00000000 in ?? ()

Maybe xqs does not support the multiple desktops of CDE.  

The program does not crash with XFCE, Ol(v)wm,WindowMaker or Fvwm.
